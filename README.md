A helper, one-off repository to create scripts that will generate resources like screenshots or diagrams for my portfolio website, stored separately at: https://github.com/PrzemyslawKepka/pk-data-sol-website

1) Some of the projects that I cover were done under NDAs, meaning that I cannot share any code or screenshots. 

But to still represent them visually somehow, AI-generated scripts will create an output resembling real project, but they will not cover any confidential data.

2) I also write blog posts, and some of them might require extra diagrams and charts
So these will be generate programatically here as well

Generation logic and examples are described in `CLAUDE.md` file.
